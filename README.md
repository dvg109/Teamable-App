This is a guided project from the IT Fundamentals course from Techworld With Nana. It mini-bootcamp for learning the complete Software Development Life Cycle. It begins with developing frontend using vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS and transitions into using VueJS. Then you develop backend using NodeJS. Next, it guides you to connect backend to a database (MongoDB). Next it guides you to write unit and integration tests. And finally, it guides you to create a Linux server on a cloud platform and eventually deploy the application on the configured server.
